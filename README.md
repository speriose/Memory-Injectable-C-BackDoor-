# C++ TCP Client â€“ File Transfer & Remote Command Simulation

## Overview
This project is a **TCP client implemented in C++** that demonstrates advanced **network programming, file handling, and remote command execution** techniques. It is designed as a **professional showcase of system-level programming skills** and network communication capabilities in a controlled environment.

## Key Capabilities

### File Transfer
- Uploads files from the client to a server using **chunked transmission**, ensuring large files can be handled efficiently.
- Automatically calculates **file size** before transmission and verifies successful transfer.
- Supports binary files and ensures data integrity during network transmission.

### Remote Command Execution
- Receives commands from a server and executes them locally on the client machine.
- Captures the **command output** and can send results back to the server.
- Demonstrates integration of C++ with system-level process management.

### Network Communication
- Establishes a **TCP connection** to a specified server with robust error handling.
- Handles connection setup, transmission, and graceful cleanup of sockets using Winsock.
- Can respond dynamically to server requests in real-time.

### Professional Value
This project highlights the following competencies for employers:

- Advanced **C++ programming** including file I/O, strings, and system integration.
- Proficiency in **network programming** with TCP sockets and client-server architecture.
- Experience with **Winsock API**, asynchronous communication, and error handling.
- Ability to implement **real-time data transfer** and command execution solutions.

## Note
This project is designed for **educational purposes and professional skill demonstration**. All operations are intended to run in a controlled environment, such as local networks or virtual lab setups.
